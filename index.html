		<h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>

		<p>This section just contains some basic terms used across this web site that might be confusing.</p>
		<h3>Baker's percentage</h3>
		<p>A <em>Baker's percentage (%)</em> is a percentage value in weight of an ingredient in a recipe compared to the flour weight. An example of this would be if you had 1000g of flour in a recipe and you then added 650g of water to that recipe, the baker's percentage of the water would be 65%. This is useful in determining how wet a dough will be and makes it much easier to scale a recipe whilst maintaining the same hydration. Lets say you want to keep your dough at 65% hydration at all times but you measure up your flour and realise you only have 948g of flour instead of 1000g. Now normally this would be very annoying and make it quite difficult to determine just how much less water you need to add to your recipe now to maintain that same exact hydration; however, with the bakers percentage this is simple! A basic calculation like <code>948 * 0.65 = 616.2</code> gives us exactly what we need! Now we know we need 616.2g of water to maintain that same hydration. This is why the baker's percentage is so good!</p>

		<h2 id="beginner">Beginner</h2>

		<p><strong>Estimated total time:</strong> <em>2-3 hours</em></p>
		<p><strong>Estimated working time:</strong> <em>~30 minutes</em></p>

		<p>The beginner section will outline the most basic pizza recipe I can think of.</p>
		<p>It will not require any special equipment at all and will use the simplest ingredients.</p>
		<p>This section will also use the easiest possible method in the shortest amount of time.</p>
		<p>After this we will proceed through intermediate and advanced where equipment, method and ingredients will progressively grow in complexity.</p>

		<h3 id="beginner-equipment">Equipment</h3>

		<p>For this recipe only the <a href="#required-equipment">required</a> equipment will be necessary.</p>

		<h3 id="beginner-ingredients">Ingredients required</h3>

		<p>This sub section outlines the required ingredients for this pizza dough.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>All-purpose white wheat flour</li>
			<li>Luke warm water</li>
			<li>Instant dry yeast</li>
			<li>Salt</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="beginner-recipe">Recipe explanation & Quantities</h3>

		<p>This sub section outlines the actual recipe of the beginner pizza dough.</p>
		<p>The quantities in this section should roughly equate to two dough balls that weigh 250g each.</p>
		<p>This is pretty standard weights for large neopolitan pizzas.</p>
		<p>If the size of dough balls are too large for the style of pizza you wish to make you can also devide this dough into three pieces and roll them out thin with a rolling pin and you should achieve something entirely different.</p>
		<p>I recommend going with two though.</p>
		<p>I also recommend using the <strong>kitchen scale</strong> (if you have one) at all times to measure in grams if possible. It is <em>way more</em> accurate.</p>

		<h3 id="beginner-process">Process</h3>

	        <p>The following section outlines the process split into smaller parts to hopefully be easier to follow.</p>

		<h4>Mixing</h4>

		<ol>
			<li>Pour all the flour into your container</li>
			<li>Add all the salt and all the instant dry yeast on either sides of the flour in the bowl</li>
		        <li>Mix it all together with either your hands or a whisk</li>
		        <li>Add all the luke warm water to the mixture</li>
			<li>Mix with your hands until it starts to form a dough like shape. Try to minimise lumps and try to get all the flour wet.</li>
		</ol>

		<h4>Kneading</h4>

	        <p>Place the now rough dough on a lightly floured surface and knead it until it starts to become smooth and less sticky.</p>
	        <p>The most important part here is to just keep kneading and to refrain from adding too much flour; the dough will smoothen out as the glutens develop so give it a good solid kneading. Since you are kneading by hand you really cannot overdo this; but you can do it insufficiently, so put your back into it and give it some time.</p>
		<p>I think this step can be almost meditative once you get the flow. Try 10-15 minutes at least.</p>

		<h4>Proofing</h4>

		<p>Alright so you've needed your dough until it's smooth and you've broke a sweat. Well done! You're one step closer to a pizzaiolo.</p>
		<p>Now we are close to having a pizza dough!</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Shape the dough into a round ish ball like shape</li>
			<li>Place it back into the container you mixed in; no need to clean it</li>
			<li>Cover the container tightly with plastic wrap or the tight fitting lid</li>
			<li>Let it proof until it has doubled in size; about 1-2 hours</li>
		</ol>

		<h4>Shaping</h4>

		<p>This part is quite easy and we are almost ready to bake. Note that this takes about 20-30 minutes so if you haven't already it might be time to preheat the oven.</p>
		<p>If you are using a conventional home oven I suggest you crank that as high as it goes. Home ovens rarely even get close to the temperature that pizza ovens get so go for broke. If you do have a pizza oven however, you may want to try and regulate the temperature so that it reads about 400&deg;C in the center of the stone.</p>
		<p>Also remember to preheat your pizza stone in the oven if you have one, otherwise you might want to also preheat an oven tray upside down in the oven to act as a make shift pizza stone.</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Cut the dough into 2-3 equal sized lumps</li>
			<li>Shape these into balls</li>
			<li>Cover and let rise a bit more for about 20-30 minutes</li>
			<li>This is a good time to prep ingredients</li>
		</ol>

		<h4>Baking</h4>

		<p>Finally we have reached this point! First up; celebrate!</p>

		<p>Baking the pizza will be largely dependant on your equipment and so I won't go in to detail too much but I will just go over some basics.</p>

		<p>The <strong>most important</strong> part here is to not stress too much about if it goes horrendously wrong. This part is tricky and many mistakes will be made. Just try not to burn yourself and have fun with the process.</p>
		<p>Another <strong>important</strong> thing to note here would be that the pizza stone or baking tray always goes into the oven prior to the pizza to preheat, if you try and shape and top the pizza on a cold stone or tray and place that in the oven it will almost definitely stick to the stone or tray and you're going to not have a fun time.</p>

		<p>If you have a pizza stone and a pizza peel then all we do now is grab one of the balls of dough and stretch it out into a pizza, place it on a floured peel and slide it onto that pizza stone.</p>

		<p>If you <em>do not</em> have a pizza stone but you do have a pizza peel then use your inverted baking tray as a stone and use the peel like suggested above.</p>

		<p>If you <em>do not</em> have a pizza peel it gets trickier but in this case I would suggest using a sheet of baking paper and trying to stretch and top the pizza on top of the baking paper and then carefully transitioning this into the oven. You will then need to take the entire baking tray out with oven mitts to remove the pizza.</p>

		<p>Bake it until it looks like a finished pizza and enjoy!</p>
